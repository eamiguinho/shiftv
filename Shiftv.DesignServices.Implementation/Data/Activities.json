            "overview":"Of all the law related dramas inside and outside of the country, a majority of lawyers are depicted as heroes, either bringing tears to your eyes helping the weak underdog, or trying to advocate justice to the extreme. This has led the general public to view lawyers with eyes of respect and envy.   However, the main character of \"Legal High!!\" stands miles away from that stereotypical identity of a lawyer. Komikado Kensuke is stubborn, abusive in his language, sarcastic, moody, and an extravagant spender. To the contrary, he has never lost a case in his life. A genius at bargaining and building strategy, winning is everything to Kensuke. His love for money, fame, and women obviously collects the dislikes of other professionals in the field. Kensuke loathes the textbook of justice the young lawyers try to brandish.   Unexpectedly, Mayuzumi Machiko is a lawyer who passed her bar exam through hard studies. She is overly earnest in her mission of saving the weak, and rather clumsy and incapable of planning ahead. Her lack of versatility and strong righteousness drives her reckless, without compromise to her convictions. Passionate and determined, she is the complete opposite of Kensuke's character.   \"Justice is the winner,\" Kensuke stands by this belief without doubt. Despite the skepticism he receives for his sensational efforts, the people surrounding him begin to see that their view was but a pipe dream. In the courtroom, Kensuke reminds us of the feeling we had all forgotten: To fight with all our energy and to never give up ",

The Rupert craze actually began in 1920, when the common British newspaper, \"The Daily Express\", realized that to actually compete with rival newspapers they would need a children's comic.  The owner of the paper, Lord Beaverbrook consulted one of his chief editors, R.D. Blumenfield, about this issue.  Blumenfield was having a difficult time devising an appropriate character that would be entertaining for the children yet proper enough to please their parents.  One day Blumenfield approached another one of the newspaper's prominent editors, Henry Toutel about his dilemma.  Toutel informed Blumenfield that his wife was a relatively well-known cartoonist and children's book writer.  Henry told his wife, Mary, about the cartoon project.
